# NOTE (7/14/23)

The Graphite CLI team has decided that in order to build the ideal integrated Graphite experience, *we will be developing v1.0 of the Graphite CLI within our monorepo and leaving the public repository archived as an artifact*.  As we begin the next round of development on our CLI and the rollout of GTI, our graphical interface for branch management, this will allow us to iterate quickly and give our users the best possible experience.  We’re excited to show you what we’re working on!
